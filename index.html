    <h4>What is Cloud?</h4>    
    <p>Moving to the cloud. Running in the cloud. Stored in the cloud. Accessed from the cloud: these days is seems like everything is happening “in the cloud”. But what exactly is this nebulous concept? <br>

        The short answer is that it's somewhere at the other end of your internet connection – a place where you can access apps and services, and where your data can be stored securely. The cloud is a big deal for three reasons:</p>
        <li>It doesn't need any effort on your part to maintain or manage it.</li>
        <li>It's effectively infinite in size, so you don't need to worry about it running out of capacity.</li>
        <li>You can access cloud-based applications and services from anywhere – all you need is a device with an internet connection.</li>
        <p>This is important because there's a shift going on from office-based work to working on the move. This shift is reflected in computer hardware sales: In 2015 about 270 million desktop and laptop computers will be sold, compared to 325 million tablets and almost 2 billion smartphones.

            That makes the cloud a very good place to run business software like customer relationship management (CRM) applications – software that users need to access reliably at any time, wherever they are, and on any device.</p>
